# D3 Externs

**[D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/)** is a small, free JavaScript library for manipulating HTML documents
based on data. D3 can help you quickly visualize your data as HTML or SVG,
handle interactivity, and incorporate smooth transitions and staged animations
into your pages. You can use D3 as a visualization framework (like Protovis),
or you can use it to build dynamic pages (like jQuery).

### Externs:

This is an externs file for D3 meant to be run with the Google Closure compiler with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS. Please feel free to fork and add variable/function definitions to the externs file.

The repository is WIP.
